Short paragraph of what will be covered on this page.  Try to keep this to no more than two or three sentences. Close things out with a sentence that leads into the unordered list that follows.

* Add your Packaging Org's namespace to `sfdx-project.json`
* Use the CLI to create a namespaced scratch org
* Forget to link your namespace to your Dev Hub? You might see this error...

## Add your Packaging Org's namespace to `sfdx-project.json`
One or two sentences that give a simple overview of what the student is being asked to do.

**Replace the contents of `sfdx-project.json` by copy/pasting the following:**

**Important:** Make sure to use YOUR packaging org's namespace in place of `sfdx_isv_pkg001`
{: .notice--warning}

```json
{
  "packageDirectories": [
    {
      "path": "force-app",
      "default": true
    }
  ],
  "namespace": "sfdx_isv_pkg001",
  "sfdcLoginUrl": "https://login.salesforce.com",
  "sourceApiVersion": "44.0"
}
```

**After modifying `sfdx-project.json`, VS Code should look something like this:**

1. Something about callout number one
2. Something about callout number two
