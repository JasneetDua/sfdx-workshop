* Examine the `Amount__c.field-meta.xml` file from the converted SFDX source
* Compare the `Amount__c.field-meta.xml` and `Travel_Expense__c.object` files to observe how "source decomposition" makes SFDX and MDAPI source different

## Examine the `Amount__c.field-meta.xml` file from the converted SFDX source
One or two sentences that give a simple overview of what the student is being asked to do.

1. Something about callout number one
2. Something about callout number two
