Short paragraph of what will be covered on this page.  Try to keep this to no more than two or three sentences. Close things out with a sentence that leads into the unordered list that follows.

* Create a directory to hold our Salesforce DX projects
* Use the Salesforce CLI to create a new Salesforce DX project
* Enter the Salesforce DX project folder to see what files were created

## Create a directory to hold our Salesforce DX projects
One or two sentences that give a simple overview of what the student is being asked to do.

**Execute this command (1 of 2):**
```bash
mkdir ~/sfdx-workshop
```

**Then execute this command (2 of 2):**
```bash
cd ~/sfdx-workshop
```
**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U03_shell-mkdir-and-cd-to-sfdx-workshop.png" alt="Alt TBA" caption="Caption TBA" %}


## Use the Salesforce CLI to create a new Salesforce DX project
One or two sentences that give a simple overview of what the student is being asked to do.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:project:create -n my-managed-package
```

One or two sentences to help transition to the next activity.  Maybe a table that explains what each file/folder is and does.
