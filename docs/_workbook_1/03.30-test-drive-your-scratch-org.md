## Use the Salesforce CLI to create a scratch org
One or two sentences that give a simple overview of what the student is being asked to do.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:org:create -a PkgScratch -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:org:create`              | Description TBA                                         |
| `-a (alias)`                    | Description TBA                                         |
| `-s (xxxxx)`                    | Description TBA                                         |
| `-f (xxxxx)`                    | Description TBA                                         |


**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U03_vscode-create-test-drive-scratch-org.png" alt="Alt TBA" caption="Caption TBA" %}


## Open the new scratch org 
One or two sentences that give a simple overview of what the student is being asked to do.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:org:open
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:org:open`                | Description TBA                                         |


**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**

1. You may see a message that the CLI is waiting to resolve your scratch org's custom domain name. This will automatically clear once the domain is resolved.
2. If your default browser does not automatically open to your scratch org, you can copy and paste the special login URL that the CLI provides.  

**Note:** The URL is highlighted yellow for emphasis in the screen shot. It will not appear like that on your screen.
