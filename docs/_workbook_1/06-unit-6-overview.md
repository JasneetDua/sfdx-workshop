Now that your packaged code has been retrieved from your packaging org and converted from MDAPI to SFDX source, it's finally time to use a Scratch Org to develop some useful new features for your app.

This unit will walk you through the typical Salesforce DX development lifecycle.  In it you'll create a scratch org, push SFDX source to it, make declarative changes to your app, then pull those changes back into your local project files.

**Time Check:** This unit should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.
