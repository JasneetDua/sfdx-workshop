Many of the tools in the Salesforce DX toolkit are project-centric, and the work that you'll be doing requires more than just the Salesforce CLI.  

This unit will walk you through the process of creating a Salesforce DX project and opening that project in Visual Studio Code.  The unit closes with the creation (and destruction!) of your first scratch org.

**Time Check:** This unit should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.
