There are two groups of pre-workshop activities that students must complete before the hands-on activities can be attempted.

* First, you'll need to set up the core tools and environments required to use Salesforce DX as an ISV Partner
* Second, there is additional setup (all related to Git and GitHub) and a helpful Trailhead module that you'll need to complete before attempting the hands-on activities in the second workshop

The documentation in this section will help you complete the prerequisites for both workshops.
