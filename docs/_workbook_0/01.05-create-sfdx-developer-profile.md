**Pro Tip:** Profiles based on the SLAF (Salesforce Limited Access Free) license are restricted from accessing CRM objects like Account and Opportunity and locks down most others in your org by default.  Feel free to restrict access to any additional custom objects.  As long as the settings for the three objects follow the above documentation, your developers can successfully use Salesforce DX without requiring undue access to your PBO (Partner Business Org).
